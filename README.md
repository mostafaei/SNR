# Network-aware worker placement for wide-area streaming analytics

This repository contains the code used in [SNR], which was accepted at [FGCS'22](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2022.06.009).

## What can I find in this repo?

* `code/Python` contains SNR worker node selection algorithm in Python.
We have used this implementation to evaluate the worker node selection algorithms of SNR on three different real-world topologies when running the extended version of the Yahoo Streaming Benchmark [YSB](https://github.com/dataArtisans/yahoo-streaming-benchmark). We used this code for the evaluation in Section 7.4. 

* `code/P4` contains the P4_16 code SNR on programmable switches.<br/>
